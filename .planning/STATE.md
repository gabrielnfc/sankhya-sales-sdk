## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [Roadmap]: Phase 1 must fix TAXAJURO bug (CORE-01), token TTL guard (CORE-04), and retry jitter (CORE-05) before any sandbox validation — these corrupt test results
- [Roadmap]: Write-path retry on POST/PUT is a critical risk (CORE-07) — addressed in Phase 1 before Phase 3 write validation
- [Roadmap]: TEST-02 and TEST-03 (integration test artifacts) assigned to Phase 5 (test hardening) — the validation they prove happens in Phases 2-3, the test suite enforcement belongs in Phase 5

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- Phase 2 flag: Write-path behavior for pedidos/financeiros is partially unknown (rate limits undocumented, idempotency unverified) — treat Phase 3 sandbox runs as primary research method and budget extra time
- TypeDoc version: research recommends `^0.27.x` — verify `npm info typedoc version` before installing in Phase 6
